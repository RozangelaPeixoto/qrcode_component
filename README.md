## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (using BEM to name classes)
- Flexbox

### What I learned

It seems like a super simple project, but when I stopped to read an feedback from the same project that someone else had posted I realized that although I thought I had delivered what the design asked for, there were several issues that I could improve and this taught me even more about semantics, flexbox, height and width of elements, margin and how to use them all in favor of responsiveness. And for the first time I searched about acessivity and discover Google Lighthouse, a tool that has its own panel in Chrome DevTools, it was incredible how it helped me, because it not only points out the problem, but explains how you can solve it.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**

### Useful resources

- [Question Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31000885/align-an-element-to-bottom-with-flexbox) - This helped me position the elements without using flexbox properties as it wasn't working the way I want.
- [Google Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse) - How I only met this tool now!!! And how this is on my browser without I knowing its potential.
